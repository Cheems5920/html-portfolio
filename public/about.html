<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm currently a Software QA, working at Telus, supporting the changes on the web by performing and executing test cases, I also have knowledge of Python and getting the hang of automation test using cucumber in BDD</p>

<p>I'm taking the course to become a MERN developer as this is a job on the rise and i believe the challenges it has can be a great motivation to take the next step and become a web developer.</p>

<p>Thank you so much for reviewing my portfolio, I really enjoyed creating it as well as  all the projects I've worked on that of course are listed here for you to review!.  </p>
